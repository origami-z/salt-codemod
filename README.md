Trying to write code mod for converting `@jpmorganchase/uitk-` to `@salt-ds/*`.

## To use

1. Clone this codemod repo, then `yarn install` to get all the dependencies
2. In your project repo, update `package.json` to use `@salt-ds/*` and install dependencies
3. Run `node /path/to/this/repo/index.js`
